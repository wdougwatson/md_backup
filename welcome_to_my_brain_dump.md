# Trying Something Different
I haven't engaged in any geekery in far too long so I've decided to jump in with both feet. Since I wanted a blog that I could more easily control than the multi-headed beast that is wordpress or the utter shite that is blogger I opted for a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github Pages")  site. While You can create one with server side scripts that wouldn't satisfy my craving for geekery. I oroginally planned on using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll") but was unable to get it working proplerly under [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/ "Cygwin") so I opted for a [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/ "Pelican").    
I don't really know what the future holds for content on this site but I imagine it will be fairly random.
